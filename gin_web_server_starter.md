Welcome to **Golang Gin boilerplate**!

The fastest way to deploy a restful api's with [Gin Framework](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/) with a structured project that defaults to **PostgreSQL** database and **Redis** as the session storage.

## Configured with

* [go-gorp](https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp): Go Relational Persistence
* [RedisStore](https://github.com/gin-gonic/contrib/tree/master/sessions): Gin middleware for session management with multi-backend support (currently cookie, Redis).
* Built-in **CORS Middleware**
* Feature **PostgreSQL 9.4** JSON queries
* Unit test

$ go get github.com/Massad/gin-boilerplate
```

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Massad/gin-boilerplate
```

```
$ go get -t -v ./...
```

> Sometimes you need to get this package manually
```
$ go get github.com/bmizerany/assert
```
